# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

Spots is a responsive image-sharing web application where users can view and interact with photo cards from various locations. Built as part of the TripleTen Software Engineering bootcamp Sprint 3 project.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**
